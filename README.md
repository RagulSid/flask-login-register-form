I have just started learning Flask and I am developing a project. I plan to share some special things I do occasionally. This form I share with, in the light of new beginners. You can use this simple and useful form as you like.

### Requirements

    pip install flask
    pip install SQLAlchemy
    pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
